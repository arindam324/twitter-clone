# Twitter Clone

### this is simple twitter clone made using Next.js and tailwindcss

### to use this app first clone this repositery and either use `npm i` or `yarn` to install all the packages

### then go to http://localhost:3000 to see the changes [ Mobile version only for now ]

### I'm using NextAuth for google authenctication so you need to create a .env file and put `GOOGLE_CLIENT` and `GOOGLE_SECRET` into this file
